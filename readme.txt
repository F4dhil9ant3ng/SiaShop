1. import database.sql
2. copy to your local server
3. change database privilege on file cfg/db.php
4. change value of $homepath on file cfg/var.php
   homepath is where index.php located after server path
   for example your index.php located in C:/xampp/htdocs/extjs/skripsi,
   where htdocs is your server path, then you should set $homepath='/extjs/skripsi'
5. enjoy
